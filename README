About:

  CheckPlaces is a Firefox extension that allows you to check your bookmarks
  in different ways. There is a basic check of your bookmarks, and optional
  checks that the pages still exist, duplicate bookmarks, and empty folders.
  You can also use it to restore favicons that have gone missing,
  and compact and check the integrity of the Places database
